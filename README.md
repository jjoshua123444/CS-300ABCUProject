# CS-300ABCUProject

The problem that was being adressed in the projects for this course was to develop a program that had two specific requirements: print a list of all the Computer Science courses in alphanumeric order and for a given course, print out its title and prerequisites. Approaching this problem, I began by understandinf the tasks. Secondly, making sure I had a good understanding of the different data structures, such as vectors, hash tables, and trees. Having a good understanding allowed me to make the decision on choosing the appropriate data structure. Data strucutres are important to understand because they allow for our foundation of the program and manage the data involved. Data structures can improve the performance of the program. During the project I encountered different roadblocks. The roadblock itself was choosing the data strucutre that was suitable for the project. I was able to overcome this roadblock by utilizing previous assigments and resources. While working on this project I was able to expand my approach to design software and develope programs. This project showed me the importance of analysis, planning, and various factors such as performance, and efficiency. The ABCU Project has given me a better understanding on how to wrtite code that is easy to understand, maintainable, and adaptable. Through the careful planning of the project in the given assigments I was able to achive this.
